//import React from 'react';

//Inside a loop it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, either of the following would work:

//<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
//<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>

//The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and Function.prototype.bind respectively.

//In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.
